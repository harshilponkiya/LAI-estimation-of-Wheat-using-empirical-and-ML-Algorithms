# LAI-estimation-of-Wheat-using-empirical-and-ML-Algorithms
This study estimated the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of wheat crops in the Palampur Subdistrict, Himachal Pradesh, using machine learning algorithms. The findings show that multiple linear regression (MLR), combined with vegetation indices like NDVI, CI, Osavi, EVI, and GNDVI, accurately estimates LAI.
